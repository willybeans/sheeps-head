#### you may run into issues with hot reloading: 
When using automatic compilation of your code, you could run into issues when saving your files. Some editors have a "safe write" feature that can potentially interfere with recompilation.

To disable this feature in some common editors, see the list below:

Sublime Text 3: Add atomic_save: 'false' to your user preferences.
JetBrains IDEs (e.g. WebStorm): Uncheck "Use safe write" in Preferences > Appearance & Behavior > System Settings.
Vim: Add :set backupcopy=yes to your settings.
